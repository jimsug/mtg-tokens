# Won't fixes

For lack of a better name, there are a number of things which won't be added as features, or won't be fixed. You can ask for these, but your request may be closed as `wontfix` without further comment. This list may be added to over time.

* **Support for token art**: This application is intentionally lightweight, so won't have token art. If you'd like something that looks more visually-appealing (and possibly has token art), check out https://www.mtgtokens.app

* **"Complex behaviour"**: This is a basket of use-cases which are too niche, or which would require disproportionate effort to address in the app (and would likely sacrifice a pleasant UX for other users). Things that come to mind: buttons for "add a token with one more +1/+1 counter than this one" or "create this token but with 1 more power and toughness"
